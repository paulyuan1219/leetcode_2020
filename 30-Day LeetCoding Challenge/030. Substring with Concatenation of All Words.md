You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

 

Example 1:

Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
Example 2:

Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []

Solution:

My first solution is to convert words (bag of words) into a unique key. Then we can use a slide window on s. For each window, we convert it to a temp key and count it if both keys match. Here, I just use a string, but there should be better ways.

```
class Solution(object):
    def findSubstring(self, s, words):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if len(words) == 0:
            return []
        
        # first, create a signature
        res = []
        key = ''.join(sorted(words))
        M = len(words[0])
        
        N = len(key)
        
        for i in range(len(s)-N+1):
            tmp_words = [''.join(s[j:j+M]) for j in range(i, i+N, M)]
            tmp_key = ''.join(sorted(tmp_words))
            if tmp_key == key:
                res.append(i)
        return res
```
Please note i's range. The last possible index of i is actually `len(s)-N`. That's why there's a `+1` in the range function
