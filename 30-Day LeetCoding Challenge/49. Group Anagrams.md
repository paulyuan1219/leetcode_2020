Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

Example:

Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
Note:

All inputs will be in lowercase.
The order of your output does not matter.

Solution:

My first idea is: given a string, get each char in it, sort them in order, then concatenate them into another string. If 2 strings are mapped to the same target, they are anagrams.

```
class Solution(object):
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        """
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
        """
        
        if len(strs) == 0:
            return [[]]
        
        ht = {}
        for elem in strs:
#            k = ''.join(sorted(elem))
            k = tuple(sorted(elem))
            if k not in ht:
                ht[k] = []
            ht[k].append(elem)

        return ht.values()
```
This submission is good, but too slow. <br>

After checking the official solution, it suggests that using a set as key in hash is not ideal. A string will be better. More important, we can use some encoding method to represent a string. For example, 'aaabbbb' will be saved as 'a3b4'.

```
        ans = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
            ans[tuple(count)].append(s)
        return ans.values()
```
However, this is also very slow. And this is what I have suspected.
