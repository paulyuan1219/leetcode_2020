# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

Example 1:

```
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

Example 3:

```
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

Solution 1: 

重复利用python现有的Counter以及sort函数

```
from collections import Counter

import operator

class Solution(object):
    def frequencySort(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        c1 = Counter(s)
        l1 = [(k,v) for k,v in c1.items()]
        l1.sort(key = operator.itemgetter(1), reverse = True)
        l2 = [k*v for (k,v) in l1]
        return "".join(l2)
```
另一种方法是充分利用counter的函数

```
from collections import Counter

import operator

class Solution(object):
    def frequencySort(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        c1 = Counter(s)
        l2 = [k*v for (k,v) in c1.most_common()]
        return "".join(l2)

```


我这个方法是最最基本的，貌似官方的方法更加好，可以看一下。
