Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Solution 1:

Use two pointer method as follows:
```
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        if len(s) < 2:
            return
        i, j = 0, len(s)-1
        while i < j:
            s[i],s[j] = s[j],s[i]
            i+=1
            j-=1
        return
```

Solution 2: Recursive

```
class Solution(object):

    def reverseString(self, s):
        """
        :type s: List[str]
        :rtype: None Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        if len(s) < 2:
            return
        
        # Sol 2: use recursive method
        def helper(p1, p2, ls):
            if p1 >= p2:
                return
            ls[p1],ls[p2] = ls[p2],ls[p1]
            return helper(p1+1, p2-1, ls)
        return helper(0, len(s)-1, s)
```
