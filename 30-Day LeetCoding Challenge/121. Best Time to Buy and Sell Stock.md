Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.


Solution

The first thought is brute-force, we we just consider each possible buying date and selling date. The time complexity is O(n^2)
```
        # sol1. brute force, which is n^2
        # cannot pass due to time complexity
        if len(prices) < 2:
            return 0
        
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)-1):
            for j in range(i+1, len(prices)):
                curr = prices[j] - prices[i]
                if res < curr:
                    res = curr
        return res

```
However, this exceeds the time limit of Leetcode.

A second thought is that we can just iterate this arry from left to right. Suppose we are at position i now. The idea is that, in [0, 1, ..., i-1], we already know the minimum value g_min and current best gain g_gain. If prices[i] > g_min, then we can gain the difference if we buy at the g_min price and sell it today. This value will be compared with g_gain to see which one is larger. If prices[i] < g_min, we should just do nothing.

```
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = 0
        if len(prices) < 2:
            return res
        
        if prices[0] < prices[1]:
            g_min = prices[0]
            g_gain = prices[1] - prices[0]
        else:
            g_min = prices[1]
            g_gain = 0
        
        for i in range(2, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > g_min:
                curr_gain = prices[i] - g_min
                if g_gain < curr_gain:
                    g_gain = curr_gain
            else:
                g_min = prices[i]
        return g_gain
```
