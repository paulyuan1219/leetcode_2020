Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.
Example:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Restrictions:
The string consists of lower English letters only.
Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

Solution:

```
class Solution(object):
    def reverseStr(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        res = list(s)
        
        pos = 0
        N = len(s)
        while pos < N:
            if pos+k-1 < N: # where pos+k-1
                i,j = pos, pos+k-1
                while i < j:
                    res[i],res[j] = res[j],res[i]
                    i+=1
                    j-=1
#                res[pos:pos+k] = res[pos+k-1:pos-1:-1]
                pos += 2*k
            else:
                i,j = pos, N-1
                while i < j:
                    res[i],res[j] = res[j],res[i]
                    i+=1
                    j-=1
#                res[pos:] = res[N-1:pos-1:-1]
                break
        return ''.join(res)
```
A more concise solution is as follows:
```
class Solution(object):
    def reverseStr(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        res = list(s)
        
        pos = 0
        N = len(s)
        while pos < N:
            i,j = pos, min(pos+k-1, N-1)
            while i < j:
                res[i],res[j] = res[j],res[i]
                i+=1
                j-=1
            pos += 2*k
        return ''.join(res)
```
However, the time/space complexity is the same

```
class Solution(object):
    def reverseStr(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        res = list(s)
        
        pos = 0
        N = len(s)
        while pos < N:
            i,j = pos, min(pos+k, N)
            res[i:j] = reversed(res[i:j])
            pos += 2*k
        return ''.join(res)
```

This one is obviously faster, due to the usage of `reversed`

Note, the usage of `res[pos:pos+k] = res[pos+k-1:pos-1:-1]` is pretty tricky. Normally it works. But when pos=0, the result is unexpected. Need to figure it out.
