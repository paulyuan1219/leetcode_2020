Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

Example: 

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

Solution:

The idea is simple, just do it recursively. The only problem is to prevent infinite loop. To achieve that, we can just save it in a hashtable. That's it.

```
import math
def func(n, ht):
    if n == 1:
        return True

    if n in ht:
        return False

    ht[n] = 1

#    r = 0
#    while n > 0:
#        r += (n%10)**2
#        n = math.floor(n/10)
    
    s = str(n)
    s1 = [int(x)**2 for x in s]

    return func(sum(s1), ht)
        
class Solution(object):
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        ht = {}
        
        return func(n, ht)

```
