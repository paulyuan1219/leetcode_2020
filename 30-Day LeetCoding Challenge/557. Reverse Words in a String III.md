Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Example 1:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

Solution:

```
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        l1 = list(s)
        p1 = 0
        while p1 < len(l1):
            p2 = p1 + 1
            while p2 < len(l1) and l1[p2] != ' ':
                p2 += 1
            
            if p2 == len(l1):
                # we are at the end
                l1[p1:p2] = reversed(l1[p1:p2])
                return ''.join(l1)
            else:
                # we see l1[p2] is a space
                l1[p1:p2] = reversed(l1[p1:p2])
                p1 = p2 + 1
            
        return ''.join(l1)       
```

Note, I also tried the following code, but it exceeds time limit
```
    while p1 < len(l1):
        try:
            p2 = l1[p1+1:].index(' ')
        except:
            p2 = len(l1)
        ...
        

```
