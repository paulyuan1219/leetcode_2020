# Largest Divisible Subset
Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies:

Si % Sj = 0 or Sj % Si = 0.

If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,4,8]
Output: [1,2,4,8]

没通过。

本来想用贪心算法，但是没通过，感觉不能直接用贪心算法啊。

```
class Solution(object):
    def largestDivisibleSubset(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        nums = sorted(nums)
        res = []
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            res_tmp = [nums[i]]
            
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[j]%res_tmp[-1] == 0:
                    res_tmp.append(nums[j])
            
            if len(res_tmp) > len(res):
                res = res_tmp
        return res
```

根据上面这个，好像我应该用dp来做啊
